# my-responsive-calculator
I am a mathematics person at heart and so it made sense for me to attempt to make a calculator app. 
This is only the first step and in the next one, I hope to be able to attempt to have more complex operations such as decimals and percentages. 
Hopefully I will also incoperate sine, cosine and tan too.
