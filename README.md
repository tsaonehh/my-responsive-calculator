# my-responsive-calculator
i am a mathematics person so honestly it made sense for me to attempt to make a calculator app. 
This is only the first step and in the next one, i hope to be able to attempt to have more complex operations such as decimals and percentages. 
Hopefully i will also incoperate sine, cosine and tan too.
